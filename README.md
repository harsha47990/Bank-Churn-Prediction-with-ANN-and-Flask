# Bank-Churn-Prediction-with-ANN-and-Flask

- This repository will have complete deep learning based banking churn prediction ANN model which will analyze tha probablity for a customer to leave.
</br>

## Project Description
### Welcome Screen
- The main welcome screen is made in **HTML5** and **CSS3** with a basic and simple design.
- Here is the main screen for the **Bank Churn Prediction** Interface for the bank admin.</br>

### Bank Admin Input
- The bank employee has to enter the details of the customer whose churn they want to analyze.
- Below is the screenshot of the input being filled by bank employee.</br>

## Analysis and Accuracy
- The Prediction engine is built over a deep **Artificial Neural Network** backed with **[Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)**.
- I have achieved an accuracy of around **~86%** on both training and testing data.</br>
- The model is Tuned over the Hyerparametes using Keras-tuner to find the best **Units**, **epoch** and **learning rate** for generating the best possible combination for best fit model.

## Deployment and Production
-  The **API interfacing** for the deplyment on [Localhost](http://localhost:5000/index) is done using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).
- The server is run on Local system during the staging of the project.

## Predictions
- The final prediction of the model is the percentage of churn for that customer.
-  The prediction signifies the chances of the customer to leave the services of the bank which makes the bank to _focus more on such such customers_ and try to retain them.
